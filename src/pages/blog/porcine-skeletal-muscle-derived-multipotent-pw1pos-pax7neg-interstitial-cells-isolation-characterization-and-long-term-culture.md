## [](<>)Abstract

Developing effective strategies for the regeneration of solid tissue requires an understanding of the biology underlying the tissue’s endogenous repair mechanisms. PW1/Peg3pos/Pax7neg skeletal muscle-derived interstitial progenitor cells (PICs) were first identified recently in the interstitium of murine skeletal muscle and shown to contribute to muscle fiber regeneration in vivo. PICs, therefore, represent a novel candidate resident progenitor cell for muscle regeneration. To explore the potential of these cells for clinical translation, we must ascertain the presence of PICs in larger mammalian species and identify criteria to successfully isolate and expand this population. In this study, we report the isolation, characterization, and maintenance of multipotent PICs from juvenile porcine skeletal muscle. We show that porcine PICs can be reproducibly isolated from skeletal muscle, express stem/progenitor cell markers, and have a stable phenotype and karyotype through multiple passages. Furthermore, porcine PICs are clonogenic and multipotent, giving rise to skeletal myoblast/myotubes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. In addition, PICs can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells. These results demonstrate, in an animal model with size and physiology extrapolatable to the human, that porcine skeletal muscle-derived PW1pos/Pax7neg PICs are a source of stem/progenitor cells. These findings open new avenues for a variety of solid tissue engineering and regeneration using a single multipotent stem cell type isolated from an easily accessible source, such as skeletal muscle.
