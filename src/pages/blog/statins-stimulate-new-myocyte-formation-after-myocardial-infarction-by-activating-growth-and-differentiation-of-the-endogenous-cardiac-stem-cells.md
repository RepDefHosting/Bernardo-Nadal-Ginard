## Abstract

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) exert pleiotropic effects on cardiac cell biology which are not yet fully understood. Here we tested whether statin treatment affects resident endogenous cardiac stem/progenitor cell (CSC) activation in vitro and in vivo after myocardial infarction (MI). Statins (Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin and Pravastatin) significantly increased CSC expansion in vitro as measured by both BrdU incorporation and cell growth curve. Additionally, statins increased CSC clonal expansion and cardiosphere formation. The effects of statins on CSC growth and differentiation depended on Akt phosphorylation. Twenty-eight days after myocardial infarction by permanent coronary ligation in rats, the number of endogenous CSCs in the infarct border zone was significantly increased by Rosuvastatin-treatment as compared to untreated controls. Additionally, commitment of the activated CSCs into the myogenic lineage (c-kitpos/Gata4pos CSCs) was increased by Rosuvastatin administration. Accordingly, Rosuvastatin fostered new cardiomyocyte formation after MI. Finally, Rosuvastatin treatment reversed the cardiomyogenic defects of CSCs in c-kit haploinsufficient mice, increasing new cardiomyocyte formation by endogenous CSCs in these mice after myocardial infarction. In summary, statins, by sustaining Akt activation, foster CSC growth and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The activation and differentiation of the endogenous CSC pool and consequent new myocyte formation by statins improve myocardial remodeling after coronary occlusion in rodents. Similar effects might contribute to the beneficial effects of statins on human cardiovascular diseases.

## [](<>)1. Introduction

The demonstration that new cardiomyocytes (CMs) are produced in the adult mammalian myocardium, albeit in limited amounts, generated a flurry of interest in harnessing this adult neo-cardiomyogensis to foster adult myocardial regeneration and repair in order to ameliorate the devastating impact of myocardial damage and heart failure in an aging human population [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B1-ijms-21-07927),[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B2-ijms-21-07927),[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B3-ijms-21-07927)]. This paradigmatic change, together with the identification and characterization of adult cardiac stem cells (CSCs) [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B1-ijms-21-07927)] gave birth to the bourgeoning field of adult myocardial regeneration. Unfortunately, since its inception, myocardial regeneration in the adult has been hotly debated and controversial. While the discovery and characterization of the phenotype and regenerative potential of adult resident cardiac stem/progenitor cells was initially met as a significant advancement in cardiac biology, some recent data from genetic fate mapping studies have questioned the endogenous regenerative role of CSCs after myocardial infarction [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B4-ijms-21-07927),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B5-ijms-21-07927),[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B6-ijms-21-07927),[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B7-ijms-21-07927),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B8-ijms-21-07927),[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B9-ijms-21-07927)]. However, these latter data remain doubtful because the technology used to purportedly track the fate of the CSCs in vivo fails to efficiently label and track them [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B4-ijms-21-07927),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B5-ijms-21-07927),[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B6-ijms-21-07927),[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B7-ijms-21-07927),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B8-ijms-21-07927),[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B9-ijms-21-07927)].

Aside from the ongoing controversy, several studies have shown that CSCs, apart from their cardiomyocyte regenerative potential, are promising regenerative agents for their paracrine action when used as allogenic cell therapy [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B10-ijms-21-07927),[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B11-ijms-21-07927),[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B12-ijms-21-07927),[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B13-ijms-21-07927),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B14-ijms-21-07927),[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B15-ijms-21-07927),[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B16-ijms-21-07927),[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B17-ijms-21-07927)] and their regenerative potential can be fostered by several experimental approaches [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B3-ijms-21-07927),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B10-ijms-21-07927),[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B11-ijms-21-07927),[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B12-ijms-21-07927),[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B13-ijms-21-07927),[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B18-ijms-21-07927),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B19-ijms-21-07927),[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B20-ijms-21-07927),[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B21-ijms-21-07927)]. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are well known lipid-lowering drugs that significantly and reproducibly reduce morbidity and mortality from both acute and chronic coronary syndromes [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B22-ijms-21-07927),[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B23-ijms-21-07927)]. Besides their primary lipid-lowering effect, statins exert pleiotropic beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in primary and secondary prevention: they improve cardiomyocyte survival [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B24-ijms-21-07927)], reduce vascular inflammation [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B25-ijms-21-07927),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B26-ijms-21-07927)] and decrease platelet aggregation and thrombus deposition [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B27-ijms-21-07927),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B28-ijms-21-07927)]. Of interest, statins have been shown to affect the biology and function of several stem and progenitor cells, improving their regenerative potential and preventing their age-dependent senescent phenotype [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B29-ijms-21-07927),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B30-ijms-21-07927),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B31-ijms-21-07927),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B32-ijms-21-07927)]. On this basis, to gain further insights into the mechanisms by which statins improve myocardial remodeling, here we investigated the effects of statins on resident CSCs in vitro and in vivo.

### 2.1. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Enhance Rat Cardiac Stem Cell Growth, Clonogenesis and Spherogenesis In Vitro

To test whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) regulate adult CSC proliferation in vitro, BrdU incorporation and cell growth curve were employed. To this aim we isolated CD45neg/CD31neg/c-kitpos CSC-enriched cardiac cells (hereafter abbreviated as CSCs) from rat donors as previously reported [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B11-ijms-21-07927),[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B12-ijms-21-07927),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#B33-ijms-21-07927)] and plated them in presence or absence of a lipophilic or hydrophilic statin (see below). To assess the effects of statins on the rat CSC cell cycle activation in vitro, primary cultured CSCs at P1 were serum starved for 48 h and parallel cultures were then treated either with 1 µM simvastatin (SIM), as a prototypical lipophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, 1 µM rosuvastatin (ROSU) or 5 µM pravastatin (PRAVA), respectively, as new and old generation hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or just vehicle. BrdU (10 µM) was added every 12 h and BrdU incorporation was measured after 24 h by immunostaining. [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#ijms-21-07927-f001) shows that ROSU, SIM and PRAVA treatment increased on average the number of BrdU positive CSCs by 50% when compared to vehicle ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#ijms-21-07927-f001)A,B). Concurrently, and in agreement with the BrdU data, the growth curve shows that by 72 h in culture, ROSU, SIM and PRAVA on average increased the number of CSCs by 55% when compared to vehicle ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663580/#ijms-21-07927-f001)C).
