## Abstract

c-Kit, a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is involved in multiple intracellular signaling whereby it is mainly considered a stem cell factor receptor, which participates in vital functions of the mammalian body, including the human. Furthermore, c-kit is a necessary yet not sufficient marker to detect and isolate several types of tissue-specific adult stem cells. Accordingly, c-kit was initially used as a marker to identify and enrich for adult cardiac stem/progenitor cells (CSCs) that were proven to be clonogenic, self-renewing and multipotent, being able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells *in vitro* as well as *in vivo* after myocardial injury. Afterwards it was demonstrated that c-kit expression labels a heterogenous cardiac cell population, which is mainly composed by endothelial cells while only a very small fraction represents CSCs. Furthermore, c-kit as a signaling molecule is expressed at different levels in this heterogenous c-kit labeled cardiac cell pool, whereby c-kit low expressers are enriched for CSCs while c-kit high expressers are endothelial and mast cells. This heterogeneity in cell composition and expression levels has been neglected in recent genetic fate map studies focusing on c-kit, which have claimed that c-kit identifies cells with robust endothelial differentiation potential but with minimal if not negligible myogenic commitment potential. However, modification of c-kit gene for Cre Recombinase expression in these Cre/Lox genetic fate map mouse models produced a detrimental c-kit haploinsufficiency that prevents efficient labeling of true CSCs on one hand while affecting the regenerative potential of these cells on the other. Interestingly, c-kit haploinsufficiency in c-kit-deficient mice causes a worsening myocardial repair after injury and accelerates cardiac aging. Therefore, these studies have further demonstrated that adult c-kit-labeled CSCs are robustly myogenic and that the adult myocardium relies on c-kit expression to regenerate after injury and to counteract aging effects on cardiac structure and function.

## [](<>)Introduction

In developed countries, modern and up-to-date guidelines-recommended treatments based on solid clinical and basic cardiovascular research have significantly reduced the mortality for acute cardiovascular (CV) syndromes ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). However, the improvement in primary treatment of cardiovascular syndromes bargained a steep surge of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), a syndrome that nowadays has numbers similar to an epidemy and takes the highest toll on human lives among CV diseases ([3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B3)).

Indeed, during acute life-saving interventions, most patients irreversibly develop myocardial injury, from which CHF develops. CHF has no available curative therapies and the prognosis for patients is poorer than that for most cancers, having an average survival of only 3–5 years after its onset ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1)–[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B3)). There are almost 40 million patients worldwide with HF that account for a significant part of the annual hospital admissions and that absorb several billions of dollars to the USA healthcare. Similar number of patients and annual costs are emerging to be found in the EU healthcare systems after several statistical analysis ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). It follows that HF treatments currently in use are only symptomatic if not just palliative when considering mortality as main endpoint—with heart transplant as only valid yet practically un-available solution to overcome it. It is imperative indeed to develop technologies to better understand and to monitor CV diseases, their symptoms and complications, with the aim to preserve/enhance the function of the surviving cardiomyocytes, while also to replace the lost cardiomyocytes, primary causes of CHF ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

Myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart disease in general, is the primary etiology of CHF ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B3)). Also in the cases of the structural cardiomyopathies, where the CHF is of non-ischemic origin, the primary issue is the lack of the myocardium to undergo a robust cardiomyocyte replacement ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). On surprisingly, therefore, regenerative biology/medicine has raised with the goal to find an effective and broadly available therapy to refresh the contractile muscle cells lost and/or permanently dysfunctional in consequence of the primary injury ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B4)). Unfortunately, the predominant skepticism about the intrinsic endogenous regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart, including the human have produced often contradictory approaches to perform myocardial repair/regeneration ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

Until sufficient scientific data are obtained to eventually overcome this widespread skepticism, whereby hard clean and clear data remove the need for interpretations and opinions, no clinical repair or regeneration protocol will be ever able to answer the question of whether it is feasible to functionally regenerate the failing human heart ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

## [](<>)Biology of the Adult Heart: the Old Paradigm

The adult cardiomyocytes (CMs), terminally differentiated cardiac parenchymal cells, permanently withdrawn from the cell cycle with no capacity to replicate, have been classically defined as *elementi perenni*, similarly to neurons, and thus believed to last a lifetime ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B6)). The main underlying and ensuing biologic dogma was and still practically remains that, when the heart is subjected to a prolonged work overload or to a diffuse and/or segmental injury, the CMs respond increasing their size, becoming hypertrophic to accommodate a larger number of its sarcomeres to sustain the increased work or just die ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

This static view of the biology of the adult hearts postulates that from cradle to grave no new CMs are therefore added and it turns that to maintain an equilibrium for the heart to properly function and sustain the systemic circulation throughout life, CM death is a rare, if not negligible, event ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). Thus, under this dogmatic view, post-natal life of the heart is not ruled by a cell homeostasis process where cardiac muscle cells die and are consequently replaced in response to wear and tear and/or injury ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

On this basis, one of the first attempt, still ongoing, to obtain cardiac muscle regeneration has been and continues to be the re-activation of mitotic division of mature terminally differentiated CMs ([7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B7)). However, genetic modification of the myogenic differentiation network and muscle cell identity of adult CMs to force their division to produce a robust number of new CMs has mainly resulted in increased polyploidy and/or death, both *in vitro* and *in vivo* ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B7)–[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B9)). On the other hand, experimental approaches conducted in order to increase CM division, which have been proven to foster beneficial functional *in vivo* effects ([9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B9), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B10)), are not necessary to clearly rule out whether the detected new cardiomyocyte formation is the product of the division of pre-existing terminally differentiated CM or of myocyte progenitors before their terminal differentiation ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). Moreover, the heart is the organ of the adult human body less affected by neoplastic transformation ([11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B11)), which has been classically referred to the “stubborn” terminally differentiated state of the adult CMs. It logically turns that the inhibition and/or removal of the CM inhibitory cell cycle checkpoints maintaining their differentiated state in the adult heart in the myocardium will run the high risk of breaking the intrinsic protection of the adult heart from neoplastic development ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

Overall, the classic dogma of the biology of the adult heart considered nil the regenerative potential of the adult myocardium and its response to increased workload limited to CM hypertrophy. Under these biologic tenants, no effective protocol for myocardial regeneration could be developed unless exogenous effective regenerative agents were discovered and applied. Cardiovascular therapeutic research has been developed under this biologic umbrella up to today ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

## [](<>)Biology of the Adult Heart: The New Paradigm

The historic paradigm of mammalian CM terminal differentiation and permanent withdraw from the cell cycle ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B5)–[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B7), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B12)) started to be challenged by the evidence arising from few reports of sporadic new CM formation in the normal and pathological adult heart ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B14)). As the number of this new CM formation was very small, and it had no biological basis to be mechanistically interpreted, they were disregarded as a curiosity or just an experimental artifact with no physiological significance ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

The initial yet largely ignored detection of new CM formation in the adult mammalian heart has been recently confirmed and undoubtedly proven by cutting-edge molecular and genetic tracking techniques that have nowadays established that new CMs are continuously born in the post-neonatal mammalian heart, including the human ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B15)–[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B20)). However, despite this evidence, the quantification of this CM renewal in the adult heart remains highly debated and it is still widely regarded as a neglegible and therefore physiological useless phenomenon ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B20)). In adult healthy humans, using radioactive isotope decay, an annual CM turnover rate of ~0,5% has been reported through mathematical extrapolation ([16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B16), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B21)). In small mammals, the estimated range of CM annual turnover spans from 0.001 to 4%. Nevertheless, the reliability of all these estimates remain questionable simply because they are extrapolations and not diresct experimental measurements ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).

Nevertheless, while there is a lack of agreement about CM turnover rates, and myocardial regenerative response in general, there is a consensus that the heart response to damage is not sufficient to counteract the CM loss and dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI) and in CHF ([2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)). Because replacement of lost and injured CMs will continue to call for effective regenerative protocols, it is mandatory for the cardiovascular research community to define an experimental protocol that can directly and accurately quantify CM turnover in health and disease. Nonetheless, the undisputed existence of an intrinsic regenerative response with new CM formation in the adult myocardium is a solid basis to continue the search for its precise nature with the logical expectation that mastering its underlying mechanisms will provide new solutions to develop clinically meaningful protocols of myocardial protection, repair and/or regeneration ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593054/#B2)).
